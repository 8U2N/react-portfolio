        Activities • Military Science Fiction Author: Writing is a deep-seeded
        passion of mine. Humans learn best when information is communicated
        through stories. Stories that resonate stick with us, teach us, inform
        us...and can change us. To date I have published Redshift, the first
        novel in a trilogy with Temple Dark Books. The sequel, Apogee, is slated
        for release December 2022. I am currently coauthoring with Rick Partlow,
        and I have also written a separate novel Calamity’s Edge, published by
        Aethon Books, release date TBA.
